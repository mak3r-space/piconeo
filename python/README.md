# Working with Python Source Code

The files in this directory were used as the **starter** for this project. They
can run with a [MicroPython] environment on the [Raspberry Pi Pico] and control
a [Neopixel] LED strip. The source and setup is based on this
[YouTube Tutorial].

1. Install the minimal [Thonny IDE].
2. Connect your Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer's USB port.
3. In Thonny, install MicroPython:
   1. Click the bottom right corner menu in Thonny
   2. Select "Install MicroPython."
   3. Select `Family`: `RP2`
   4. Select `Variant`: `Raspberry Pi Pico/PicoH`
4. Install the `picozero` library for the Raspberry Pi Pico:
   1. Select `Thonny` → `Tools` → `Manage Packages…`
   2. Search for `picozero` ([https://pypi.org/project/picozero/](https://pypi.org/project/picozero/))
   3. Click `Install`.
